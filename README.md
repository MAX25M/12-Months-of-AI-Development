# 🚀 12 Months of AI: From Foundation to Capstone
**Goal:** Master Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning through project-based learning.

This repository serves as my professional portfolio and "dev-log" for 2026. Each month, I document my progress, commit code, and build a project that contributes to my year-end Capstone.
